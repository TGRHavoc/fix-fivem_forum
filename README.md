## Updating

Tampermonkey should automatically keep the script up to date.
If you want to manually update the script you can do that as well.

This is the same as all other Tampermonkey scripts.

- Open up the dashboard
- Go to the "Installed userscripts" tab
- Check the script from the table
- Select "Trigger Update" from the dropdown
- Click "Start"
